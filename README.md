# PopulationGraphs
A simple web app that can visualize population graphs for different countries using World Bank open data.  
Based on workshop MOOC by Sympa.

Tools
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Data: World Bank Open Data (e.g  https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/FIN/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?format=json)

Aim was to build minimal working version of the application (MVP = Minimum viable product). 
MVP has
* Possibility for the user to input a country
* Fetching the population time series for that country
* Showing the population graph
